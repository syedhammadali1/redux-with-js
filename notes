# three principles of redux

 1) All of your states stored within an object in your store

 2) the only way to update state is dispatch an action which an an object that describe what happened.

 3) write pure reducer (how to update state)


# action creator is a function which return action object like

funcion orderCake(){
    return {
        type:'CAKE_ORDERED'
    }
}

# order cake is a action creator



# store 

 1) create a store with createStore(reducer) 
 2) store methods
  # getState() get store states
  # dispatch() call an action which will help for updating state
  # subscribe() this will be called when store state will be  changed
