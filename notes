# three principles of redux

 1) All of your states stored within an object in your store

 2) the only way to update state is dispatch an action which an an object that describe what happened.

 3) write pure reducer (how to update state)


# action creator is a function which return action object like

funcion orderCake(){
    return {
        type:'CAKE_ORDERED'
    }
}

# order cake is a action creator
